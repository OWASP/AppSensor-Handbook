[The OWASP AppSensor Handbook](http://leanpub.com/AppSensor) is a book about the [OWASP AppSensor project](http://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project).

## How finished is The OWASP AppSensor Handbook

This Book is still a work in progress, if you are reading via [the Github repository](http://github.com/OWASP/AppSensor-Handbook), that's wonderful! Make sure to give me your feedback, Github Issues exist for a reason.

The book is also available as PDF7, EPUB8 (iPad, iPhone, iPod) and MOBI9 (Kindle) file at [lean-pub.com/AppSensor](http://leanpub.com/AppSensor). The suggested price is $9.99, but you can get the book for free! Click Buy the ebook now! button and move the You pay slider to the left hand side until the amount goes down to $0.00. Of course, you can move the slider to the right hand side and pay more for the book. 

If you're already reading via purchased pdf, that's _awesome_ and you should feel good. Thanks for supporting this project :)
