# A roadmap of the OWASP AppSensor Handbook

This book is written in 6 parts each covering a different and essential part of the OWASP AppSensor development design pattern.

- Part 1: **Overview** 

This is a high-level overview of the concept and why it is different. We then describe the general approach to implementing AppSensor within application software projects.

- Part 2: **Define** 

This is the set of chapters that is of interest to Management. Why do they want an OWASP AppSensor and what is the set of actions they need to put in place to instantiate the OWASP AppSensor.

- Part 3: **Design**

This is the set of chapters that is of interest to Software Architects. What are the various requirements for an OWASP AppSensor and what the design trade-offs in different deployment configurations of the OWASP AppSensor.

- Part 4: **Develop**

This is the set of chapters that is of interest to Software Engineers (Developers). What is required for a developer to develop an OWASP AppSensor. Additionally, I imagine this is also about how to test the code to verify that it manages the exceptions as required.

- Part 5: **Deployment**

This is the set of chapters that is of interest to Operations. How do you deploy, tune and configure the OWASP AppSensor?

- Part 6: **Appendices**  

This section contains various external resources and references for further study and information.
