-# Design

A> I imagine this is the set of chapters that is of interest to Software Architects. What are the various requirements for an OWASP AppSensor and what the design trade-offs in different deployment configurations of the OWASP AppSensor.

The suggested approach to detection point selection includes the following steps:

- Requirements 
- Model development 
- Optimization 
- Attack analysis  

We will consider the detection requirements to create a model, look at how to optimize this model and check it using attack analysis before considering the response actions in step 3.  

The analysis is suitable both for consideration during procurement, as well as development processes. Outsourced development and services could be asked to implement AppSensor and provide access to the event data.
