# Introduction

OWASP AppSensor Project defines the concept of real-time attack-aware detection and response for software applications and provides guidance and example code.  

Part 1 Overview - this is a high-level overview of the concept and why it is different. We then describe the general approach to implementing AppSensor within application software projects.

Part 2 Define - this is the set of chapters that is of interest to Management. Why do they want an OWASP AppSensor and what is the set of actions they need to put in place to instantiate the OWASP AppSensor.

Part 3 Design - this is the set of chapters that is of interest to Software Architects. What are the various requirements for an OWASP AppSensor and what the design trade-offs in different deployment configurations of the OWASP AppSensor.

Part 4 Develop - this is the set of chapters that is of interest to Software Engineers (Developers). What is required for a developer to develop an OWASP AppSensor. Additionally, I imagine this is also about how to test the code to verify that it manages the exceptions as required.

Part 5 Deployment - this is the set of chapters that is of interest to Operations. How do you deploy, tune and configure the OWASP AppSensor?

Part 6 are the appendices which contain various external resources and references for further study and information.
