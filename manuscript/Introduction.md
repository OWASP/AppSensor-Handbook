# Introduction

OWASP AppSensor Project defines the concept of real-time attack-aware detection and response for software applications and provides guidance and example code.  

This document follows the OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model or SAMM. Therefore we examine the lifecycle of OWASP AppSensor from the Governace, Construction, Verification and Delpoyment phases of that maturity model. 

Part 1 provides a high-level overview of the concept and why it is different. We then describe the general approach to implementing AppSensor within application software projects.

Part 2 is an overview of the governance or 

Part 3 is an overview of the construction
 
Part 4 is an overview of the verification

Part 5 is an overview of the deployment
